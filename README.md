Hello to anyone who stumbled on this page, I hope you're doing good.
Idk how you got here but I'd like to inform you that I don't work on
this anymore. Infact I haven't done so for about half an year now.
There were a lot of things that could've improved but I just don't
have the time needed. If you are a recruiter and want to look at
something I have worked on recently then head over to [Whiner App](https://whiner2-82d5e.web.app/).It is what I
usually work on in my spare time.

Check out the live version here [Best Jobs](https://bestjobs-a6f12.web.app/).

## About

Recruiter dashboard for a job portal website in react. Allows recruiter authentication and job postungs.

## Backend

I used firebase's admin SDK to get up and running with a backend service.

## Styling

All component based custom CSS without any framework :)

### Current Features

- [x] Authentication

- [x] Create Job post

- [x] Edit posts

- [x] Search jobs with skills

- [x] Add or remove skills required

- [x] Autocomplete search results

- [x] View a detailed version for every job post

- [x] Authentication based access to all features

## Firebase

This app is powered by Firebase utilizing service for Authentication, Database, Storage and Functions.

## Components

Most components are fully functional independently. Mock data using JSON server would get them running.

## Build and run

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies

### `npm start`

To launch the webpack dev server if you have a data endpoint setup

## What platform does it work on?

As of now, only desktops/laptops or slightly bigger screens. I plan on adding the styling for mobile in the future.

## What features/functionalities I would like to add ?

- [ ] Job applicant dashboard and features that come with it.
- [ ] Improved Design
